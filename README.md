If anyone stumbles here trying to find an incremental parser, here is the 1998 paper ([Efficient and Flexible Incremental Parsing](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/SL_Graham/publication/2377179_Efficient_and_Flexible_Incremental_Parsing/links/004635294e13f23ef1000000/Efficient-and-Flexible-Incremental-Parsing.pdf
)) that I should have found before embarking in this failed (expectations not met) project.

If you are still interested in Parsley, go read the old [README](DONTREADME.md)
